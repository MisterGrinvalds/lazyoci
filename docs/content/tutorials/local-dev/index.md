# Local Development Setup

In this tutorial series, we'll set up a local registry for development and experimentation. This is perfect for testing lazyoci features and understanding different OCI artifact types.

## What We'll Accomplish

1. **Start a local registry** using Docker Compose
2. **Connect lazyoci** to the local registry
3. **Push test artifacts** of various types
4. **Explore artifact types** and their visual indicators

## What You'll See

- A local registry running on your machine
- Test artifacts with different OCI media types
- Color-coded artifact type badges in the TUI
- The full development workflow for working with registries

## Time Required

About 15 minutes total.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- The lazyoci source code (for test fixtures)

If you don't have the source code, you can still follow the first two parts and see how local registries work.

Ready? Let's [start your local registry](./local-registry.md)!
