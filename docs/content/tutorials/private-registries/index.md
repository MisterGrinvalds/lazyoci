# Working with Private Registries

In this tutorial series, we'll connect lazyoci to your organization's private container registry. Most teams have private registries for their internal applications and sensitive images.

## What We'll Accomplish

1. **Add a private registry** with authentication
2. **Test the connection** to verify it works
3. **Use existing Docker credentials** automatically
4. **Browse private repositories** and artifacts

## What You'll See

- How to securely add registry credentials
- The registry list with your private registry included
- Authentication working seamlessly in the TUI
- Private repositories appearing alongside public ones

## Time Required

About 10 minutes total.

## Prerequisites

- A private container registry you have access to (like AWS ECR, Azure ACR, or Harbor)
- Valid credentials for that registry

If you don't have a private registry, you can still follow along with the concepts and come back when you have access to one.
